You only need to do until the level 5~6. The level is less important than the test it'self.
Different from the previous game, this one is not easy, even using basic math, and excluding division.
The game it'self focus in develop the mental math instinct, the way the test is build is for this porpouse. Not to solve only.
The dificulty is base in memorization, how many test you need to memorized.
I use math, to not let you use visual memory, but imaginary visual memory, this is: you imagine the solution then store in you memory.""")

# The common punity is regression of level, but you already will not out of level 0, that mean game over that is the maxim penauty, where the game close itself.
# The Level is the 10^Level. The size of the level is the power of 10.
